# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

`npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/deploy.js`

Deployer: `0xfF3E2F85e7FBD67Fd7E5f9BAFF8372Cf568AEBCc`

Deployer Enumerable: `0x6473c117cF18E6e2048A6cAAb159636f850512d7`

Deployer with From: `0x0AafF6BE35280E3dD35f564a7B1afFa75D5fC646`

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
