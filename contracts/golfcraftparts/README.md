# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

To test run `npx hardhat test`

To deploy to mumbai run `npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/deploy.js`

To flatten `npx hardhat flatten > flat.sol`
